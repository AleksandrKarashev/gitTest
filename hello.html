<span>
  This is some text before the <div> element.
  <div>
    This is the content inside the div.
  </div>
</span>
However, it's important to keep in mind that nesting a block-level element like <div> inside an inline-level element like <span> might not always be semantically appropriate. It can lead to unexpected rendering and layout issues depending on the CSS styles applied. In most cases, it's better to use <div> elements to group block-level content and <span> elements to style inline content.
